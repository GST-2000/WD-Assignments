        <h3>Air Pollution Prediction Using Deep Learning</h3>
        <p>The goal of this Project is to learn more about the Air Quality Index (AQI), which determines whether or not the air around us is contaminated. I considered employing a hybrid model based on CNN and LSTM to estimate PM2.5 levels of air pollution in Beijing's urban region. For correlation, we used the data of stations. The spatial properties and internal characteristics between different factors were extracted using CNN, and the prediction effect was improved using LSTM. The primary conclusions of this work are that by using CNN and LSTM, we can obtain the spatial and temporal aspects of the data with high accuracy and stability.

        <h3>IOT Based Water Monitoring System</h3>
        <p>This Projects helps the farmer on the daily basis where there is no need of any labour workers to water the crop, the whole process of watering the crop will take care of this prototype, it detects the moisture in soil and gives water to crop by calculating the water in the storage tank and the whole data of water consumed will be stored to cloud using wifi module ESP8266
