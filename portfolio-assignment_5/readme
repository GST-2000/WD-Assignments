SCSS Features
Variables: Variables are utilized to store and reuse information throughout the program, enhancing maintainability.

Custom Properties: CSS custom properties (or variables) prefixed with -- are used for defining reusable values and are referenced using the var() function.

Nesting: Selectors are nested inside other selectors, improving code organization and readability by following a clear hierarchy.

Interpolation: Values of variables or expressions are embedded within strings using #{}.

Placeholder Selectors: Placeholder selectors denoted by % are defined but not directly output in the compiled CSS. They can be extended by other selectors.

Mixins: Reusable pieces of code (mixins) are defined and included in other selectors to maintain consistent styles across the website.
